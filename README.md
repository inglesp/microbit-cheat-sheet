## About

The website is built by Jekyll from `YAML` files in the `_data_` directory. Each file corresponds to a card on the website.

They're easy to edit with the github web-based editor. The rest of it is coming!

It makes extensive use of the [offical docs](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/blob/master/docs/index.rst) and the data files are released under the same license.

## Why

I've given Scratch cheat sheets to kids in my class and they've always made amazing programs (see my [Scratch Profile!)](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/pixxy/).

This the version for the micro:bit!
